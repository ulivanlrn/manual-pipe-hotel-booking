## Analyzing the hotel booking dataset and developing a manual ML pipeline for a binary classification task
#### In this learning project, I analyzed a raw dataset and applied LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier to solve a binary classification problem. 

#### The main goal was to improve the models' performance and evaluation metrics on the dataset. To achieve this, I systematically followed steps such as data imputation and transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, encoding, selection, cross-validation, inspecting feature importances, and more. This gradual procedure is demonstrated in the notebook. 

#### Finally, I formatted all as modular code and created an ML experimentation environment, where each experiment is controlled via configuration files and tracked using an MLflow tracking server.

### Next steps
#### In my next project, I am eager to implement an automated ML pipeline with dynamic data collection, automated model retraining, and real-time inference.
